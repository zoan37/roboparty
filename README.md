RoboParty is a 3D world where you can party with friends using a robot avatar controlled by AI. It uses [window.ai](https://github.com/alexanderatallah/window.ai), which allows you to plug in your own AI model (e.g. GPT-3). You can talk to the AI to change your username and avatar color, perform different moves, emotes, and facial expressions, or have general conversations.

RoboParty is a multiplayer generalization of the [Robot Companion demo](https://github.com/zoan37/robot-companion).
